My work included usability audits and designing sitemaps, which resulted in a **40% reduction in support queries**. The project involved a deep dive into existing user flows, identifying pain points through heuristic evaluation, and proposing a streamlined information architecture. The final designs were prototyped in Figma and tested with a sample group of students and faculty, leading to significant improvements in user satisfaction.",

I conducted a full-cycle research process to inform the design, including surveys, heatmaps, and journey mapping. The goal was to create a self-sustaining community where alumni could easily find and connect with mentors. The final product was a high-fidelity prototype that demonstrated the core user journey from onboarding to finding a mentor and scheduling a meeting.",
